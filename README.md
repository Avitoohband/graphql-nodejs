# graphql-nodejs
GraphQL Node.js API
A scalable and robust GraphQL API built with Node.js and TypeScript. This project leverages GraphQL to efficiently manage and query data while using best practices in modern Node.js development.

Features
GraphQL API: Efficient querying and manipulation of data via GraphQL.

TypeScript: Enhanced code maintainability and type safety.

GraphQL Playground: Explore and test your API through an interactive playground.

Scalable Structure: Organized codebase that’s easy to extend with new features.

Prerequisites
Node.js: v14 or later

npm: v6 or later

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Avitoohband/graphql-nodejs.git
cd graphql-nodejs
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

If provided, duplicate the environment sample file and adjust settings as needed:

bash
Copy
cp .env.example .env
Note: If no .env.example exists, refer to the documentation (or comments within the code) for the required environment variables.

Running the Application
Development Mode
To run the project in development mode with live reloading (using tools like nodemon and ts-node):

bash
Copy
npm run dev
This script watches your source files for changes and automatically restarts the server.

Production Mode
For production, compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript before running the server:

Compile the Code:

bash
Copy
npm run build
This command generates JavaScript files (typically in a dist/ directory) based on your TypeScript source.

Start the Server:

bash
Copy
npm start
GraphQL Playground
Once the server is up, access the GraphQL Playground in your browser at:

bash
Copy
http://localhost:4000/graphql
Use the playground interface to explore, test, and develop queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
